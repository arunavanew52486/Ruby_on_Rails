token based auth, without devise

First start with the basics of rails, study MVC and the folder structure
Make a basic CRUD (understand the routing, database migration etc)
Implement authentication using 'devise' gem (Source: https://rubygems.org/)
Also implement token based authentication (without using 'devise')
