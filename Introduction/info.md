## Here Document in Ruby
    "Here Document" refers to build strings from multiple lines.

    Following a << you can specify a string or an identifier to terminate the string literal, and all lines following the current line up to the terminator are the value of the string.

    If the terminator is quoted, the type of quotes determines the type of the line-oriented string literal.
    
    Notice there must be no space between << and the terminator.

Here are different examples −
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/ruby -w

print <<EOF
This is the first way of creating
here document ie. multiple line string.
EOF

# same as above
print <<"EOF";
This is the second way of creating
here document ie. multiple line string.
EOF

# you can stack them
print <<"foo", <<"bar"
    I said foo.
foo
    I said bar.
bar

#! execute commands
print <<`EOC`
    echo hi there
    echo lo there
EOC
```

## Ruby BEGIN Statement
```
BEGIN {
   code
}
```
Declares code to be called before the program is run.

***Example***
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/ruby

puts "This is main Ruby Program"

BEGIN {
   puts "Initializing Ruby Program"
}
```

## Ruby END Statement
```
END {
   code
}
```
Declares code to be called at the end of the program.

***Example***
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/ruby

puts "This is main Ruby Program"

END {
   puts "Terminating Ruby Program"
}
BEGIN {
   puts "Initializing Ruby Program"
}
```

## Ruby Comments
- Single line: Using the hash(#) character
    ```
    # I am a comment. Just ignore me.
    or
    name = "Madisetti" # This is again comment
    ```
- Multi Line/Block Comment: From the interpreter with =begin/=end
    ```
    =begin
    This is a comment.
    This is a comment, too.
    This is a comment, too.
    I said that already.
    =end
    ```
