# Rails: Introduction

Rails is a **web-application framework** that includes everything needed to create **database-backed** web applications according to the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern**.

- Written in Ruby by **David Heinemeier Hansson**.
- You could develop a web application **at least ten times faster** with Rails than you could with a typical Java framework.
- Being a **full-stack framework** means all the layers are built to work seamlessly together with less code.

MVC divides your application into **three layers**: **Model**, **View**, and **Controller**, each with a specific responsibility.
